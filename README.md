Device used : Pixel 5 API 33

This is a Weather App built with React Native and Android Studio for the use of an emulator.

The app has 3 screens only, that shows the current weather, upcoming weather and cities.

This app requires fetching data from OpenWeatherAPI to fetch data about weather at local geographical location as well as information of weathers of other cities provided by the API. 

Things to improve : 
- Learn to properly manage the env file as crash happens whenever I try importing env file into my App.jsx
- Frontend styling could be done better
- Learn more about useContext, as well as different types of StackNavigator offered to beautify my mobile app.
